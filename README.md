# Newspaper Annotation Tool (NAT)

Newspaper Annotation Tool (NAT) is an open-source tool designed to assist media researchers and academicians in coding newspapers faster for content analysis. NAT is built by modifying the code of VGG Image Annotator version 2.

## Features

- **Automatic Attribute Extraction**: Extracts publication, date, page, volume, and issue information from the file name and automatically reflects that in the file attributes.
- **Common Region Attributes**: Adds common region attributes like headline, byline, and body.
- **CSV Export**: Coded data can be exported in CSV format for easy import into different data analysis software.

## Installation

To use NAT, download the release package and open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Usage

1. **Add Images**: Presently, only individual image files can be added.
2. **Add Additional Attributes**: You can add additional attributes according to your needs, like the type of content (Ad, Article, Classified, etc.).
3. **Annotate**: Use the annotation tool to mark regions and add attributes such as headline, byline, and body using the Annotation Editor.
4. **Export**: Once the annotations are complete, export the data as a NAT CSV file for further analysis.


## Future Roadmap

Following are the features and enhancements that are planned for the future development:

1. [ ] Add PDF support: Presently only individual images can be added.
2. [ ] OCR support: An optional feature to be able to connect to text extraction services like AWS Textract.
